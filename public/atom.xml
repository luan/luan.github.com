    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was hacking around with Ember.js and had to do a kind of complex form.
All fields were bound to one object and I had a hard time styling and binding everything.
While doing this I got myself thinking of <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form">simple_form</a>
and how it would be helping me if I could use it.</p>

<p>And why not create a form builder for Ember? Yeah why not, I decided to try. I can&#8217;t say I failed
miserably because the idea is cool, I like what I wrote in the <a href="https://github.com/luan/ember-formbuilder/blob/master/README.md">README</a>
and how things are defined to work. But no doubt the code ended up a pile of crap,
complicated, hard to understand and hard to evolve from.</p>

<p>This post is about the idea. And to tell you guys that I will now rewrite it (yeah I know,
I&#8217;m rewriting a project that has what, 2 days life? But one should fail ASAP).</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated, I&#8217;m really new to testing javascript (and to testing at all)
but I&#8217;m finding my way in that. Now let&#8217;s talk about the form builder.</p>

<h1>Ember FormBuilder</h1>

<p>Based on simple_form primarily Ember FormBuilder aims to be the toolkit to build from basic to
complex forms that binds automatically to your ember objects. It&#8217;s really customizable by just
defining a mixin with your markup definitions, just like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'><span class="nv">Bootstrap = </span><span class="nx">Ember</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Mixin</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">create</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nv">cancelClass: </span><span class="s">&#39;btn btn-danger&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">Ember</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">FormBuilder</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">pushMixin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Bootstrap</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;bootstrap&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you are familiar to simple_form syntax the handlebars helpers we define will be just the
thing you were looking for. You can define a form with <code>{{#formFor "object"}}</code> and define
imputs with <code>{{input "name"}}</code>. As simple as that. You can find out more about it by reading
the <a href="https://github.com/luan/ember-formbuilder/blob/master/README.md">README</a> on github.</p>

<p>There is also support for some kind of internationalization, I say somekind because you
set an object <code>Ember.FormBuilder.STRINGS</code> with some string values (again refer to README
here) and you have to work your way to make it internationalized in there, it&#8217;s something
to be thought further later, but that&#8217;s another subject for another time.</p>

<h1>Ok</h1>

<p>Yeah I mean, that&#8217;s the whole thing. I just wanted to show that. I will rewrite it now
using decent patterns and making things more reusable and easier to understand. Will
write decent unit tests and integration tests too, currently there is just a bunch of
weird tests that I don&#8217;t belive that covers much of it.</p>

<p>The code is in github <a href="https://github.com/luan/ember-formbuilder">here</a> and if you
have time and want to help I would be delighted. Of course, read the README and
point out flaws if you see some.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, good bye.</p>

    <link href="http://luan.github.com/2012/03/06/using-facebook-js-sdk-with-emberjs/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-06T10:25:00-03:00</updated>
    <id>http://luan.github.com/2012/03/06/using-facebook-js-sdk-with-emberjs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my first blog post and it will be as simple as that.</p>

<h3>Using the ember-facebook library</h3>

<p>I wrote a (<em>really</em>) simples addon for <a href="http://www.emberjs.com">Ember.js</a> to automatically load the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/">facebook javascript sdk</a>, it&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.github.com/luan/ember-facebook">ember-facebook</a> as you&#8217;d expect.</p>

<p>To use it you just have to download the compiled js file from the downloads page on the github repository. The library is written in <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a> and I do <a href="http://arcturo.github.com/library/coffeescript/">love CoffeeScript</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/downloads/luan/ember-facebook/ember-facebook.js">Download ember-facebook.js</a></p>

<p>Once you done it include it right after the actual Ember.js file, and before your application one, do it as you are used to.</p>

<p>Right now you can use it like this, on your application creation include the Facebook Mixin:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Application Configuration</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'><span class="nv">App = </span><span class="nx">Em</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Application</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Em</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Facebook</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">set</span> <span class="s">&#39;appId&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;YourAppId&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<!-- more -->


<p>And it will graciously load the Facebook JS SDK for you, you don&#8217;t have to do anything else. Now you are able to use the <code>FB</code> object to call Facebook&#8217;s API, and we assigned a FBUser to your App to reffer to the logged in user.
If you want a login button you can do something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Simple login/logout buttons</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>{{#if App.FBUser}}
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="err">{{</span><span class="na">bindAttr</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;App.FBUser.picture&quot;</span> <span class="na">alt=</span><span class="s">&quot;App.FBUser.name&quot;</span><span class="err">}}</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    {{App.FBUser.name}}
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;#&quot;</span> <span class="err">{{</span><span class="na">action</span> <span class="err">&quot;</span><span class="na">logout</span><span class="err">&quot;</span> <span class="na">target=</span><span class="s">&quot;FB&quot;</span><span class="err">}}</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Logout<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>{{else}}
</span><span class='line'>  {{#view Em.FacebookView type=&quot;login-button&quot; data-size=&quot;xlarge&quot;
</span><span class='line'>                          data-scope=&quot;email, offline_access&quot;}}
</span><span class='line'>    Connect
</span><span class='line'>  {{/view}}
</span><span class='line'>{{/if}}
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that we are checking for the existance of App.FBUser and then displaying the user names and picture together with a logout link if the user is present OR we show a custom view called FacebookView that basically creates a view of the Facebook SDK, you can check more on their documentation.</p>

<p>Basically we create a button with the xlarge size and ask for the scopes &#8220;email&#8221; and &#8220;offline_access&#8221; with the content &#8220;Connect&#8221;.</p>

<p>You can customize it however. You could either create a link to that, just bindint the action &#8220;login&#8221; to the target &#8220;FB&#8221; (as we did with logout).</p>

<h3>Creating the ember-facebook library</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/luan/ember-facebook/blob/master/src/ember-facebook.coffee">sources</a> for the library are really really simple. I basically observes the &#8220;appId&#8221; attribute and when that changes it loads the Facebook JS SDK for that app.</p>

<p>Whenever the user changes (login, logout, app authorization, etc) the method <code>updateFBUser</code> is called, updating the App.FBUser object on your application. You can do whatever you want with this binding, observe it, put it in the DOM, whatever.</p>

<p>We also have a App.FBloading binding which is a boolean that basically tells that we are waiting a facebook response.</p>

<p>You might want to show something based on this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Fancy Loading</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>{{#if App.FBloading}}
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;my-fancy-loading&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Waiting for Facebook<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>{{/if}}
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>That&#8217;s all folks</h3>

<p>I hope you like it, as it being my first post it might look retarded, but I hope it was helpful for someone.</p>

<p>See ya!</p>
