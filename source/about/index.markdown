My name is Luan, I am a software engineer. I do my living working at [Pivotal
Labs](http://pivotallabs.com) here in San Francisco, which is pretty amazing.

One of the biggest joys in my live is typing things into
[Vim](http://www.vim.org), and developing my Vim setup never gets old.

I love music, all of it, specially Brazilian and punk rock. Rise Against is the
best band out there. I'm also a singer in my meantime.

I am addicted to soccer, [Coritiba](http://coritiba.com.br) fan, the most
victorious team in the world.

Kau is my wife and my full-time companion, thank's my love!
