My name is Luan Santos, I'm addicted to Ruby.

Me and Kau
But I also like other programming languages like Javascript and C. I worked as a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)  developer on [Shuffler.fm](http://shuffler.fm) . Now I am on Go2nPlay doing some crazy stuff on every web technology I know.

I love music, all of it, specially Brazilian and punk rock. Rise Against is the best band out there. I'm also a singer in my meantime.

I also love soccer, love [Coritiba](http://coritiba.com.br) , the most victorious team in the world.

Kau is my wife and my full-time companion, thank's my love!

By the way, I also love potatoes <3!
